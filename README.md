# Pygame Tetris

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and Pygame. It features basic gameplay mechanics such as moving and rotating Tetrominos, scoring, clearing lines, and a game-over condition when Tetrominos stack to the top of the screen.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Score tracking
- Line clearing mechanics
- Game over state

## Prerequisites

Before running this game, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

Python can be downloaded from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/), and Pygame can be installed using pip:

'''bash
pip install pygame
Installation
'''

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:


git clone [https://github.com/moscolitos/tetris-pygame/]
cd pygame-tetris


## Running the Game

python tetris.py

## Controls

- Arrow Left: Move Tetromino left
- Arrow Right: Move Tetromino right
- Arrow Up: Rotate Tetromino clockwise
- Arrow Down: Soft drop Tetromino

## Enhancements
Here are some proposed enhancements that could be added to future versions of the game:

- Ghost Piece: Display a ghost piece that shows where the Tetromino will land.
- Hold Feature: Allow the player to hold a Tetromino to be used later.
- Next Piece Preview: Show the next few Tetrominos to be dropped.
- Leveling System: Implement a leveling system where the game speeds up and the scoring increases as the player clears more lines.
- Sound and Music: Add background music and sound effects for line clears and Tetromino movements.
- High Score System: Implement a local high score system where players can see their top scores.
- Multiplayer Mode: Develop a mode where players can compete against each other online.
- Responsive Design: Make the game window size adjustable or responsive while keeping the gameplay experience consistent.
- Detailed Statistics: Provide detailed game statistics post-game, such as total lines cleared, number of each type of Tetromino used, and playing time.
